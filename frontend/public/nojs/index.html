          <p>Hi! I'm Josh, a backend systems engineer with a love for intelligent design, beautiful code, and automating the boring stuff that surrounds it.</p>
<p>I deliver backend APIs, infrastructure automation, and high-availability systems for enterprise clients - everything from real-time audit logging and network monitoring to CRM integrations across multiple SaaS platforms. I'm especially at home in the nuts and bolts: data pipelines, observability, deployment workflows, and making sure things don't wake you up at 2am (unless you want them to). I'm into the kind of automation that makes a deployment rock-solid reliable.</p>
<p>I also enjoy working on normal fun things that human beings enjoy, like writing code for personal projects ranging in scale from &quot;cute&quot; to &quot;aww, no really, that's cute&quot;. This website is one of them! When I'm not in a code editor, you'll probably find me painting models, out exploring the city, or catching a film at my local cinema (support your local independent screens!). I'm also a big believer in accessibility and building things that work for everyone - it's a personal priority as well as a professional one.</p>
<p>I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science with a double major in Software Development and Data Science from the University of New England (NSW), where I graduated on the Dean's List. These days I do most of my learning through building and doing - but it was a good start!</p>
<p>This site is both a portfolio and a bit of a playground, and it looks like you've found the no-JS view. Take a look around and enjoy this simplified version of the site - JavaScript is optional here!</p>

Hi! I'm Josh, a backend systems engineer with a love for intelligent design, beautiful code, and automating the boring stuff that surrounds it.

By day I deliver backend APIs, infrastructure automation, and high-availability systems for enterprise clients - everything from real-time audit logging and network monitoring to CRM integrations across multiple SaaS platforms. I'm especially at home in the nuts and bolts: data pipelines, observability, deployment workflows, and making sure things don't wake you up at 2am (unless you want them to). I'm into the kind of automation that makes a deployment rock-solid reliable.

I also enjoy working on normal fun things that human beings enjoy, like writing code for personal projects ranging in scale from "cute" to "aww, no really, that's cute". This website is one of them! When I'm not in a code editor, you'll probably find me painting models, out exploring the city, or catching a film at my local cinema (support your local independent screens!). I'm also a big believer in accessibility and building things that work for everyone - it's a personal priority as well as a professional one.

I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science with a double major in Software Development and Data Science from the University of New England (NSW), where I graduated on the Dean's List. These days I do most of my learning through building and doing - but it was a good start!

This site is both a portfolio and a bit of a playground, a reflection of how I like to build: flexible, practical, and with just enough fun baked in. Hope you find something here that you like!

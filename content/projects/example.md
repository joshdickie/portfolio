## Overview

The Example Project is a personal project I never built because it's not real, it's an example. Like, obviously. I guess it's a MERN stack app or something since I want to include tags in my example.

## Architecture

The system consists of:

- **Nothing** - No technology handles anything.
- **Nada** - Integration with Nana microservice, which does apsolutely Nada.
- **Zilch** - Again, it doesn't do anything.

## Challenges

Working with incomplete (non-existent) data posed an early challenge - I had to find a way to make inferences from zero information (well, not really; I didn't have to do anything). As an unexpected plus, the data were entirely consistent and predictable (always nothing).

## Outcome

Nothing came of this project, and nothing ever will. It taught me nothing about anything, and was never intended for use in either production or my personal life.
